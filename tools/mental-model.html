            <h3 class="text-center" >Empathise </h3> 
            <h4 class="text-center" > <em>with your users</em> </h4>
            <br>
            <p>Our main purpose with stage 1 is to gain deeper understanding with our users and the problem we are trying to solve, which in our case, we have to figure out ways to better understand people who struggle with mental health whether we have personally expereinced it or not. <br> <br> This is crucial to help us identify pain poins and struggles of our users, so that we can better define the problem we are solving. <br> </p>
            <p> For this UX kit, I will use my second UX method which you will learn more about later, <a href="../tools/interview.html">interviewing</a> people who struggle with mental health. By asking questions and listening to their stories, our goal will be to immerse ourselves in our users' environemnt and gain a deeper understanding of how they feel. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-body" >
            <h3 class="text-center" >Define </h3>
            <h5 class="text-center"><em>your users' needs, their problem, and your insights</em></h5>
            <br>
            <p>After we have talked to our users and put together all the information, now can start defining our problem in a human-centred manner. <br></p>
            <p>To better visualize the result of our stage 1 research, why don't we create a <a href="../tools/empathy-map.html">empathy map</a> to help us see the pains and gains of our users. </p>
    
            <img src="" alt="">
            
            <h5>Here are some of the problems that we see: </h5>
            <p>1. The only thing the help line cares about is whether your trying to hurt yourself or not.</p>
            <p>2. Some interviewers said they didn't seek help as they didn't wanna be viewed as sick. </p>
            <p>3. One-on-one therapy section can be expensive.</p>
            <p>4. Interviewers tend not to be able to accept the way they feel and getting frustrated about themselves.</p>
            <p>...</p>

    <div class="text-body" >
        <h3 class="text-center" >Ideate </h3> 
        <h4 class="text-center" > <em>by challenging assumptions and creating ideas</em> </h4>
        <br>
        <p>With the knowledge we got from our first two phrases, now we are ready to brainstorm solutions!</p>
        <p>How about we use the fourth method in this UX kit <a href="../tools/crazy8s.html">Crazy 8s</a> to help us with brainstorming.</p>

        <img src="" alt="">

    <div class="text-body" >
        <h3 class="text-center" >Prototype </h3> 
        <h4 class="text-center" > <em>to start creating solutions</em> </h4>
        <br>
        <p>This is an experimental phase where we create low-fi prototypes to help us investigate the ideas we've generated and find the best possible solutions.</p>
        <img src="" alt="">
    </div>


    <div class="text-body" >
        <h3 class="text-center" >Test</h3> 
        <h4 class="text-center" > <em>our solutions</em> </h4>
        <br>
        <p>This last phrase is where we test our the prototypes that we've created and redefine further problems. We can to the previous stages as time as we need without having to follow the sequence of them until we get to our desired solution.</p>
