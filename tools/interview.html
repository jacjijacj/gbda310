            <p >Here are some of the tips to help us conduct better interviews:</p>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;" >1. Don’t ask leading or directed questions.<p>
            <p>We should be open to honest feedback, leading questions implies that we also have some assumptions in our head and it is expecting a certain type of answers</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;" >2. Ask open-ended question.<p>
            <p>Avoid yes/no answers as they provide us with no useful information. Our goal is to get the users to share more than what was being asked so that we can have new findings and discover the problems and pain points. </p>

            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;" >3. Have a set of question prepared.<p>
            <p>Although user interviews are better when we conduct it in ways that feel like a conversation, we should still have a set of questions prepared that would help us address or validate some ideas that we have. Meanwhile, each time we interview with a user, we can take note on which question works and which one doesn’t. This helps us develop better questions afterwards and get better insights each time. </p>


            <br>
            <p style="font-weight: 600;" >4. Be neutral and don’t be afraid of the truth<p>
            <p>This can be scary especially if we have already invested a lot of time in our work and we are doing more research to validate what we’ve done. When conducting user research, we have to be neutral about what we are asking and don’t get defensive if our assumptions don’t get validate.  </p>

            <p style="font-weight: 600;" >Here is the list of questions I have come up with to interview people who have suffered or is currently suffer from mental illness: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What was it like when you first discovered that you're experiencing mental illness? </li>
                <li>How did you feel at the time?</li> 
                <li>What did you do in that situation? </li>
                <li>(If they have reach out to professionals for help)What made you decide to seek helps from professionals? How did you reach out to them.</li>
                <li>What was the process like?</li>
                <li>(If the interviewee is talking about experience from the past)What do you think is the most important factor that help you recovered? </li>
                <li>Do you think there's any wrong assumptions that people make about having mental health?</li>
                <li>Are there any advice that you would give to people who are going through the same thing?</li>
                    
            </ol>
